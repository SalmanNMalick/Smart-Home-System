# Smart-Home-System
A production‑style, modular smart‑home hub built on Arduino (ESP32 recommended) that supports many common sensors/actuators, exposes MQTT + REST API, includes basic automations/scenes, and supports OTA updates. The code is written to be readable and extensible so you can plug in additional sensors with minimal effort.
